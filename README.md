# Object of Customer Churn Prediction 

The objective of customer churn prediction is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to discontinue their business with a company in the near future. This can help companies proactively take measures to retain such customers and reduce the overall churn rate, leading to increased customer satisfaction and business profitability.


## What is Customer Churn

Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company's products or services during a certain period of time. It is a measure of customer attrition and can have significant impact on a company's revenue, profitability, and growth potential. High churn rates can indicate underlying issues with a company's product, customer service, or pricing, and can lead to decreased customer loyalty and negative word-of-mouth. Predicting and reducing customer churn is an important goal for companies as it can help retain valuable customers, increase revenue and profitability, and improve customer satisfaction.

## What are the Different Churn Scenario

There can be various churn scenarios depending on the type of business and the factors that influence customer behavior. Here are some common churn scenarios:

### 1. Voluntary churn:
 Customers decide to discontinue their service or product usage on their own.

### 2. Involuntary churn: 
Customers are involuntarily disconnected from the service or product due to reasons such as non-payment, technical issues, or relocation.

### 3. Competitive churn: 
Customers switch to a competitor's product or service due to better features, pricing, or overall value.

### 4. Economic churn:
 Customers churn due to economic factors such as recession, job loss, or financial hardship.

### 5. Life event churn:
 Customers churn due to a significant life event such as marriage, divorce, birth of a child, or retirement.

### 6. Seasonal churn: 
Customers churn during a particular season, such as after the holiday season or during the summer vacation period.

Understanding these churn scenarios can help companies identify the factors that drive customer behavior and develop targeted retention strategies to reduce churn.


## How to use this Repository 
In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model.
